# Console

A poorly-written limited-purpose bot made with Pycord.

## Notes

* This bot has a pretty long history, though I and you would prefer to not look at previous versions' code.
* Uses Deta as a main database and rapidjson as a cache for it.
* The description above is sarcastic.
* This README, as well as in [Reincarnation](https://github.com/Sokuto-Desu/reincarnation/) was also made for the sake of it.

## Status

Currently suspended. Will make minor changes and bug fixes.
